# 🔧 Virtual Predictive Maintenance Dashboard (MVP)

**Developed by:** Fizza R Ishaq

---

## Overview
This project is a **real-time Virtual Predictive Maintenance Dashboard** built using **Streamlit**.  
It simulates live machine sensor readings — **Temperature, Vibration, and RPM** — and predicts potential machine failures using a **Random Forest Machine Learning model**.

This is a **software-only MVP**, perfect for:
- Startup demos
- Academic presentations
- Industrial training
- Demonstrating predictive maintenance concepts

---

## Features
- Real-time simulated machine data (Temp, Vibration, RPM)
- ML-based failure prediction using Random Forest
- Interactive sliders for manual testing
- Live updating scatter and bar charts
- Professional black-themed UI
- Easy deployment on Streamlit Cloud

---

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/predictive-maintenance-dashboard.git
